# ChurnCustomers-Classification

## Introduction
Customer churn means shifting from one service provider to its competitor in the market. Customer churn is one of the biggest fears of any industry, particularly for the telecom industry. Research has shown that the average monthly churn rate among the top 4 wireless carriers in the US is 1.9% - 2%.It is a problem for telecom companies because it is expensive to acquire a new customer and companies want to retain their existing customers. Most telecom companies suffer from voluntary churn. Churn rate has strong impact on the life time value of the customer because it affects the length of service and the future revenue of the company. For example if a company has 25% churn rate then, the average customer lifetime is 4 years; similarly a company with a churn rate of 50%, has an average customer lifetime of 2 years. In the targeted approach the company tries to identify in advance customers who are likely to churn. The company then targets those customers with special programs or incentives. This approach can bring in huge loss for a company, if churn predictions are inaccurate, because then firms are wasting incentive money on customers who would have stayed anyway.

Our goal is to analyse the trend and predict from all the features given below if the person is likely to churn or not. This will help the company with an idea and take the appropriate measures to ensure that the customer is satisfied.
